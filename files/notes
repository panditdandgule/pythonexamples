Opening File:
 syntax: f=open(filename,mode)

The allowed mode in python

1)r-Open an existing file in read mode. If file does not exists then we will get FileNotFound error
2)w-Open an existing file in write mode. If file already contains data then it will overwrite file.
    If file already not exist then it will create new file.
3)a-Open an existing file in append mode. If file already contains data then it will not overite the data.
    If file already not exist then it will create new file
4)r+ To read and write data into the file. The previous data in the file will not be deleted.
     The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.
5)w+ To read and write data into the file. The previous data in the file will be overwrite.
6)a+ To append and read data from the file. It will overwrite existing data.
7)x To open a file in exclusive creation mode for write operation. If file already exists then we will get
    FileExistError.

Notes: All the above modes are applicable for text files. If the above modes suffixed with 'b' then these
        represents for binary files.

 Examples: rb,wb,ab,r+b,w+b,a+b,xb

Closing a File:
 After completing our operations on the file, it is highly recommonded to close the file.
 For this we have to use close() function.
 f.close()

The with statements:
 The with statement can be used while opening file. We can use this to group file operation statements within a block.
